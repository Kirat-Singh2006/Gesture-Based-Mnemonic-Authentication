# Gesture-Based-Mnemonic-Authentication
A "hand-passcode" system that requires the user to perform a specific sequence of 3D gestures to unlock access.

    Method: Landmark coordinate comparison.

    Logic: Tracks the relative position of fingertips (IDs 8, 12, 16, 20) against knuckles.

    Security Angle: Prevents shoulder-surfing and leaves no physical biometric residue (like fingerprints).
